- 👋 Hi, I’m Onuora and I recently graduated from the Entry to Tech: Investment Banking Bootcamp delivered by CBF in collaboration with UBS. I previously studied on Makers Academy's Software Engineering Bootcamp where I worked on projects using Python, SQL and MERN Stack among others.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about how I can leverage AI to optimise UX in my applications.
- 🌱 You can check out my current learning in my [Web Development Projects Repo](https://github.com/ow1609/Web-Dev-Projects) shows my learning as I follow the excellent [Full Stack Web Developent course on Udemy by Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/?couponCode=ST18MT12125CROW). 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an EdTech mobile app having worked as a primary school teacher for several years.
- My favourite hobbies include: yoga, reading, dog walks, tag rugby and, of course, coding!
- 😄 Pronouns: she / her
- ⚡ A fun fact I love: Tigers have striped skin, not just striped fur.
